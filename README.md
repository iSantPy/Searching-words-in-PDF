# Searching words in PDFs using Python :commputer: :file_folder:
I decided to organize the information and store it in PDF files on my laptop. I had many files stored in different directories,
and I needed to gather all these files based on common specifications. I really enjoy the power that Python delivers when handling
many files on your computer as your main task!

I used PyPDF2 to tackle this work, and I want to show you how you can use this tool for the same purposes.
